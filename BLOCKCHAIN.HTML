        <h2>What Is BLOCKCHAIN?</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be 
            tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

        <h2>Why blockchain is important:</h2>
        <p>
            Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the 
            more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information
             because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored 
             on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members.
