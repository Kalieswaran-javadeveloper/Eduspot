        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies 
            that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, 
            including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, 
            analyze data, make recommendations, and more. 

AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing,
 unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured 
content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.

        <h2>Artificial intelligence defined</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers
             and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human 
             intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. 

            AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, 
            data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, 
            linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology.
